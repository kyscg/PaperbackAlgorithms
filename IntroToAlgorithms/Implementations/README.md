# Implementations of Pseudocode

## Getting Started

### Insertion Sort

* [Insertion Sort](https://): C++ implementation of the [Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)

* [Linear Search](https://)

* [Add binary numbers](https://)

### Analyzing Algorithms

* [Selection Sort](https://)

### Designing Algorithms

* [Merge Sort](https://): C++ implementation of the [Merge Sort Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)

* [Binary Search](https://)

### Problems

* [Bubble Sort](https://)

* [Horner's Rule](https://)

* [Counting Inversions in $\Theta(n\lg{n})$ time](https://): C++ implementation of an algorithm that counts the number of [inversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_discrete_mathematics) in an array by slightly modifying merge sort.
