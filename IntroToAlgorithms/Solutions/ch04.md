## The maximum-subarray problem

**4.1-1**

What does `FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY` return when all elements of A are negative?

> It returns the largest number of em' all.

**4.1-2**

Write pseudocode for the brute-force method of solving the maximum-subarray problem. Your procedure should run in $\Theta(n^2)$ time.

```pascal
fmsbf(A, n)
    max = -INFINITY
    for i = 1 to n
        do sum = 0
           for j = i to n
               do sum = sum + A[j]
                  if sum > max
                      do max = sum
                         low = i
                         high = j

    return (low, high, max)        
```

**4.1-3**

Implement both the brute-force and recursive algorithms for the maximum subarray problem on your own computer. What problem size $n_0$ gives the crossover point at which the recursive algorithm beats the brute-force algorithm? Then, change the base case of the recursive algorithm to use the brute-force algorithm whenever the problem size is less than $n_0.$ Does that change the crossover point?

> My machine keeps giving `0ms` for input sizes upto 800 for the brute force method, which either means I'm calculating the time wrong or something weird is happening. It is also possible that I'm in possession of a supercomputer because I initially assumed that $n_0$ would be 40-50. I'm skipping this question for now.

**4.1-4**

Suppose we change the definition of the maximum-subarray problem to allow the result to be an empty subarray, where the sum of the values of an empty subarray is 0. How would you change any of the algorithms that do not allow empty subarrays to permit an empty subarray to be the result?

> If the answer is negative, it will return an empty subarray. This is analogous to not participating in trading if we know in advance that the stock price will only fall.

**4.1-5**

Use the following ideas to develop a nonrecursive, linear-time algorithm for the maximum-subarray problem. Start at the left end of the array, and progress toward the right, keeping track of the maximum subarray seen so far. Knowing a maximum subarray of $A[1,\dots,j],$ extend the answer to find a maximum subarray ending at index $j+1$ by using the following observation: a maximum subarray of $A[1,\dots,j+1]$ is either a maximum subarray of $A[1,\dots,j],$ or a subarray $A[i,\dots,j+1],$ for some $1\le i\le j+1.$ Determine a maximum subarray of the form $A[i,\dots,j+1]$ in constant time based on knowing a maximum subarray ending at index $j.$

```pascal
fmsl(A, low, high)
    left = 0
    right = 0
    temp = 0
    sum = a[low]
    for i = low to high
        temp = temp + a[i]
        if temp > sum
            sum = temp
            right = i
        if temp < a[i]
            left = right = i
            temp = sum = a[i]

    return (left, right, sum)
```
