# The Role of Algorithms in Computing (Conceptual Exercises and Solutions)

## Algorithms

**1.1-1**

Give a real-world example in which one of the following computational problems appears: sorting, determining the best order for multiplying matrices, or finding  the convex hull.

> Sorting: Points tables in football leagues, ranking Amazon search results etc.
>
> Best order for multiplying matrices: **Didn't find a good application**
>
> Convex Hull: Drawing boundaries of a city with major locations as points inside.

**1.1-2**

Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

> Memory usage, compute (CPU usage, etc), easier to debug?

**1.1-3**

Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

> Arrays, strengths are simple to store day, non-trivial sorting + searching and limitations are we can't dynamically change size.

**1.1-4**

How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

> Similarities: Both traverse graphs, both optimize for time
>
> Dissimilarities: Shortest path doesn't have any requirement to travel to certain vertices, travelling salesman needs to come back to the starting point.

**1.1-5**

Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good enough.

> Payments: Should work perfectly, and preferably instantly
>
> AI Customer Care: Approximate solutions still work pretty well.
