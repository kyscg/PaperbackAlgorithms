# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## Algorithms

* Correct Algorithms: for every input instance, they halt with the correct answer. As opposed to incorrect algorithms that don't necessarily halt at the right answer or halt with the wrong answer.

* Usual measure of efficiency is speed.

## Insertion Sort

* We must show three things about loop invariants:
    * Initialization
    * Maintenance
    * Termination
