# Solutions to Programming Challenges

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Algorithm Design

1-1: "The 3n + 1 Problem": [C++ implementation](https://) of a brute force method to solve [this problem](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=36). **Todo: A recursive solution where we store the ranks of all the elements already seen** (is this dynamic programming?)

1-2: "The Trip": [C++ implementation](https://) of the solution to [UVA Judge 10137](https://). The solution has two major features, 1) performing all computations in cents to avoid precision errors and 2) using the fact that the answer can be provided within a cent.

1-3: "Australian Voting" ~~This is turning out to be a major pain.~~ [C++ implementation](https://) of the solution to a very easy problem made difficult by how old Online Judge is. [Problem Statement](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=1083).
