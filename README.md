# Paperback Algorithms

This repository will have solutions and notes to [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) and [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/). A rough overview of the repository structure follows:

* Introduction to Algorithms
    * Notes (divided chapter wise) (not very detailed, only important/fun stuff)
    * Solutions to Exercises (Theoretical) (Detailed but also easy to understand, preferably with examples)
        * README with links
        * Solutions as .md (or is tex better?) (draw.io for diagrams? or pictures of hand-drawings?)
    * Solutions to Exercises
        * README file that has chapterwise links to code files
        * Code in C++, Java or god forbid, Python.
    * Implementations (of pseudocode in chapters)
        * README file with chapterwise links
        * Code
